# Form.io components

The Form.io components are the building blocks of a form definition. Every form step contains a form
definition with the form fields, as configured by the form designer (in the backend).

Form.io components are tree structures - layout component types contain other components themselves,
which can be used to group fields and present them in a particular way.

Every component has a `type`, and it's the type that dictates the component presentation, behaviour
and relevant component-specific options.

## Stories

Most of the stories expose the required and/or typical configuration aspects as controls, allowing
you to play around with a particular component type.

Not all upstream Form.io features are supported in Open Forms - we only implement the configuration
aspects as they are exposed in the form designer (in the backend).
