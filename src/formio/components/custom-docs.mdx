# Custom Form.io components

These components are custom component types added by Open Forms. Sometimes they extend existing
Form.io components, other times they are completely independent. Some of the custom components are
deprecated as they can be implemented using Vanilla components.

These components will not work in Form.io renderers other than the Open Forms' one, unless the
custom component type is also implemented there.
