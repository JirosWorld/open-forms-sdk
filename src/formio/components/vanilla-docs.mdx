# Vanilla Form.io components

These components are the components that are shipped by default in Form.io. Most of the component
definitions should thus also work in other Form.io renderers.

Keep in mind that we also tweak and extend some vanilla components with features specific to Open
Forms - these component definitions may not work 100% the same when taken outside of Open Forms.

## Known incompatibilities

### Columns

We use different properties for the column sizes, while Form.io uses Bootstrap-related properties.

### TextField

Open Forms implements deriving city and street name from postal code + house number data entered in
different components - this is not available outside of Open Forms.

### Currency

The upstream component has a number of bugs with negative values and formatting of zeroes, which we
patched in our own component. Otherwise it should behave the same.

### DateTimeField

Open Forms allows dynamic min/max datetime validation (relative to some variable, for example),
which is not supported by Form.io.
