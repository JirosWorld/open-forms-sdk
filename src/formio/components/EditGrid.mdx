# Repeating Group / Herhalende groep

The `editGrid` component is used to capture structured data according to a certain sub-schema where
the number of repetitions can vary. The data is stored in a `Array` where each element's data
corresponds to the nested schema of the edit grid.

Form designers can freely design the components within the edit grid, while end-users have the
controls to add additional items to the data array. In the form designer, the grid starts without
any children (empty grid).
