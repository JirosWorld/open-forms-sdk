# Columns

Columns are intended for simple grouping of components on a single line, e.g. a postal code + house
number combination. Complex nested structures are out of scope, as aligning all the labels, inputs,
help texts and error messages is not trivial due to the possible absence of these components.

**Column width**

The column width is dictated by the `size` key, which should be an integer value between `1` and
`12` since we're using a 12-column grid. On mobile, the default width is 100%, but you can tweak
this using the optional `sizeMobile` key, ranging between `1` and `4`.
