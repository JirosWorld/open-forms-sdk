# File Upload

**Note** - file uploads on the Docs page will always error due to the way the network mocking
library works. Use the canvas instead.

## File type validation errors

By selecting a `filePattern` and uploading a file of different type, it is possible to see the error
raised when a user uploads a file of wrong type.

## Error flow

The backend performs a number of checks on file uploads and may return validation errors. These are
displayed on the upload component.
