## Date field

We identify different types of date inputs, each coming with their most-appropriate UI element.

**Nearby dates**

Think of appointment dates, booking dates and similar. Here, the expected date is in the nearby
future or past. A calendar component is appropriate because:

- you can display occupied dates and/or date ranges
- you can indicate the current date
- it is not expected that the user needs to click the year/month button too many times

**Known dates (currently not supported)**

Known dates are exact dates that the user typically knows of the top of their head, such as birth
dates, credit card expiry dates...

Calendars are not suitable due to the usually bad default/initial value. Preferably they are able to
enter the numeric value for day, month and year, leveraging autocomplete as well.

On mobile devices, you'd typically want to use the native date widget too.

### Datepicker/calendar

The datepicker/calendar is suitable for nearby dates. We aim to make it accessible to assistive
technology and keyboard-only navigation.

Known issues/enhancements:

- Use arrow keys to navigate inside calendar
- Selecting a date in the next/previous month has some odd behaviour at the moment

## No asterisks

The backend can be configured to treat fields as required by default and instead mark optional
fields explicitly.
