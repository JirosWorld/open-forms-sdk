# Date Field

The date field supports multiple widgets.

## Types of dates

### Nearby dates

Think of appointment dates, booking dates and similar. Here, the expected date is in the nearby
future or past. A calendar component is appropriate because:

- you can display occupied dates and/or date ranges
- you can indicate the current date
- it is not expected that the user needs to click the year/month button too many times

See the `Datepicker` stories for this.

### Known dates

Known dates are exact dates that the user typically knows of the top of their head, such as birth
dates, credit card expiry dates...

Calendars are not suitable due to the usually bad default/initial value. Preferably they are able to
enter the numeric value for day, month and year, leveraging autocomplete as well.

On mobile devices, you'd typically want to use the native date widget too. TODO: is this statement
correct?

See the `Input group` stories for this.
