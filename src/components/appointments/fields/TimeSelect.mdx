# Select an available time

Given the location, products and date, the API endpoint returns a set of available appointment
times. These are displayed to the user as a time, but the value stored and submitted is a full
ISO-8601 datetime string.

<Canvas of={TimeSelectStories.Default} story={{height: '280px'}} />

## Interactions

- The time field is only enabled when one or more products, a location and a date have been
  selected.
- The times received from the backend are typically in UTC or otherwise timezone-aware. For the
  end-user, the times are displayed in their local timezone, configured on their OS/browser.
