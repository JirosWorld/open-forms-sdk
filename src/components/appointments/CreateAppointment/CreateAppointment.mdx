# CreateAppointment form

The create appointment UI is used when `form.appointmentOptions.isAppointment` is `true`. This
brings the user in a (mostly) fixed form step progression to select their products, appointment
details and provide contact details.

## Features

**Multi vs. single product flow**

The backend exposes information whether the enabled plugin for appointments supports multi-product
appointments or not. This drives the appointment flow - for multi-product appointments, you can add
additional products and the list of available products is fetched while passing the already selected
products to the backend - this allows only valid combinations to be returned.

For single-product, the UI is slimmed down a little bit to remove the multi-product controls, and
the "amount" field is fixed to the number "1".

**Pre-selecting a product**

You can link to the appointments flow with an optional query string parameter `product`, which
should have the value of a valid product ID. If provided, that product will be pre-selected in the
list of all products. Note that this only applies to the first product in the case of multi-product
forms.

For example, the following URLs will pre-select a product:

- `https://example.com/appointment/?product=my-product-id`, for the regular routing
- `https://example.com/#/appointment/?product=my-product-id`, for hash-based routing
