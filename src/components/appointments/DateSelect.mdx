## Disable dates outside of range

The API returns a set of available dates. All dates before and all dates after this range must be
marked as disabled, as they are not available dates.

<Canvas of={DateSelectStories.AvailableDatesRange} story={{height: '460px'}} />

## Disable missing dates within range

The set of available dates returned by the API can be sparse, e.g. to exclude Saturdays and Sundays
because appointments during the weekend are not possible, or because a date is already fully booked.
These gaps must be marked as disabled dates.

<Canvas of={DateSelectStories.DisabledGaps} story={{height: '460px'}} />

## No location selected (yet)

A date can only be selected if a location is picked, as it is required input for the API endpoint.

<Canvas of={DateSelectStories.NoLocationSelected} />

## No available dates available at all

When no appointment dates are available, instead we render an informative message.

<Canvas of={DateSelectStories.NoDatesAvailable} />

## Single date available

<Canvas of={DateSelectStories.SingleDateAvailable} story={{height: '460px'}} />
