# Choose product step

The appointment form allows making appointments for one or multiple products/services.

This component enables the UX to select the desired product and add additional products if desired.
At least one product must be provided.

## Interaction

Users can add rows for multiple products. Additional products can be removed again after adding
them, unless there's only a single row left - then removing that row is not allowed.
