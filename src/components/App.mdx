# The App

The App component is the top level entrypoint. It's responsible for rendering the outer most layout
and rendering:

- `Form` based on the `form` config that is passed with the shape from the backend API.
- the language selection component if translations are enabled. Note that the render target is
  provided via the `I18NManager` component.

<Canvas of={AppStories.Default} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={App} />

## Translations

If translations are enabled on the form, a `LanguageSelector` is rendered:

<Canvas of={AppStories.TranslationEnabled} sourceState="none" />

If they are not, no `LanguageSelector` is rendered:

<Canvas of={AppStories.TranslationDisabled} sourceState="none" />
