# Introduction

You are looking at the technical documentation for the Open Forms SDK.

We document the public API (React and Formio components) here for developers intending to
override or modify their own SDK build.

## Goals

The end-goal of the SDK is that it can adapt itself to the theme of your organization through
the use of "design tokens", following the principles of [NL Design System](https://www.nldesignsystem.nl/).

For more complex layout changes that cannot be achieved purely through design tokens, we want
to provide sufficient controls to replace our default components with your own custom components.

## Useful links

* [Main documentation](https://open-forms.readthedocs.io/)
* [NL Design System](https://www.nldesignsystem.nl/)
* [SDK npm package (WIP)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-formulieren/sdk)
* [design tokens package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-formulieren/design-tokens)

## SDK Development

* We use the `yarn` package manager
* The compatible NodeJS version is specified in `.nvmrc`

To start the development server (note: you need to have the backend server up and running):

```bash
yarn start
```

It is recommended to configure your local environment through `.env.local`, example content:

```
REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1/
REACT_APP_FORM_ID=dev
```

### Design tokens

Design tokens are defined in the [`design-tokens`](https://github.com/open-formulieren/design-tokens/) 
repository and shared between the SDK and backend project.

If the current design tokens are sufficient, installing the project dependencies will pull them in.
However, if design tokens need to be added or modified, it's recommended to check out the git submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Please avoid using sass-variables for design-tokens. The preferred approach is to use the CSS variables
resulting from the design tokens build.

### Translations/localization

We use `react-intl` to manage translations. All literals in the codebase should be defined as 
`FormattedMessage` preferable, or an equivalent construct otherwise. Please extract and compile
the messages for every PR to avoid console errors about missing translations.

The actual translations are managed right before a new version is released.

Commands:

```bash
yarn makemessages
yarn compilemessages
```

### Code-style

Please follow the existing code style. This project was initialized with Create-React-App, and that's
what we're following. There are plans to add `prettier` in the future for automated code formatting.

The project has been configured to be able to use 'absolute' imports, which means:

**Do**

```jsx
import SomeComponent from 'components/SomeComponent';
```

**Don't**

```jsx
import SomeComponent from '../../SomeComponent';
```

### Build targets

The source code is built to multiple targets for different audiences:

* UMD bundle with single JS/CSS files, for drop-in embedding and plain JS usage.
* NPM package containing the UMD bundle **and** ES-modules of the main components.
* Storybook static build (you're reading this now!)
* Docker image containing the UMD build for easy deployment, embedded in the backend build.
