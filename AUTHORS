The Open Forms SDK was not part of the original Open Forms project but was set 
up to meet the demands from Dimpact. Not only should Open Forms be able to 
show forms by itself, it should also be available as a "snippet" that can be
integrated in a CMS to show forms as part of a website.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made Open Forms that much 
better:

    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    Sven van de Scheur <sven@maykinmedia.nl>
    Sergei Maertens <sergei@maykinmedia.nl>
    Shea Meyers <shea@maykinmedia.nl>
    Bart van der Schoor <bart@maykinmedia.nl>
    Steven Bal <steven@maykinmedia.nl>
    Silvia Amabilino <silvia@maykinmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    Dimpact for their trust in us, their leadership and their financial 
    support.

    The Form.io team for making such a great open source library that speed up
    the development of Open Forms.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.
